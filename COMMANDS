select data from intercepts where freq=95955000 order by date, time into outfile "dbout" fields escaped by '';
 (*** This results in messed up output if there's more than one row comprising the audio; don't use it)
 (You can modify intercept.py and try to use that; it works better but not perfect)

command line

cat file | play -t raw -r 32k -e signed-integer -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -

# Decode FM broadcast stations
rtl_fm -f 95.7e6 -s 170k -A fast -r 32k -l 0 | play -r 32k -t raw -e s -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -
  (they suggest using -E deemp, but that doesn't work for me)
